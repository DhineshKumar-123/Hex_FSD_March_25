pom.xml add dependency as security (everything gets blocked)
we can unblock by (exclude = securityautoconfiguration.class) in  mainapplication
One Filter is created before of our spring app
We create bean of securityfilterchain
--rules of api calls

--Auth Manager to point to DB
   authencticationProvider(getAuth())
   @bean
	we need to create getAuth() method
//1--Then we need to create the encoder for the password uding BCryptPasswordEncoder
dao.setPassworedEncoder(passEncoder());
//2--take spring to my sweervice which has method to take it to db, basically i am taking spring to my db

not: spring needs the user model class to be userDetails type
class User implements UserDetails -- User is-a UserDetails(is a relation)
reason:--we then get to convert our roles in to authorities that spring wants

Note:: ensure that your passwords are saed in encoded format in Db
//this is the line
//String ecodedPass = brypt.encode(user.getPassword());
